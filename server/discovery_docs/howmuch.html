How much will I get for my car? 

If you are wanting CashNow this depends on a number of factors, and we must appraise the vehicle in your local dealership before an offer can be made. You need to book an appointment to have your car appraised. You can complete this online form here, or call us on 0800 887 637. If you want to sell through auction, what you get for your car will depend on the outcome of the auction, and the reserve you set. 

(Please note that we will no longer be issuing cheques from the 31st of July 2021. Please also check with your banks as to when they will stop processing cheques as well.)
