If I'm selling by auction, how do I set my reserve price? 

Our auction consultant will help you decide on a fair reserve price. Before you set your reserve, it pays to do some research. Here are a few tips: 

Research on our website: There are hundreds of cars on our website, with estimated auction prices and Buy Now prices for you to review. 

Attend an auction: Anyone can attend our public auctions (or watch online via Turners Live) to see what cars sell for. Find upcoming car auctions. 

Get an appraisal: We offer auction sellers a free appraisal to help set their auction reserve. You must bring your vehicle on site to get this appraisal done.
